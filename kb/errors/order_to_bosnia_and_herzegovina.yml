  # Order to Bosnia and Herzegovina
  
  FC: 🇪🇸 MAD3 / 🇪🇸 MAD4
  Resolution: Open page for resolution
  
  We don’t have any shipping methods currently available to ship orders to this country from our Spanish FCs. So we need to contact the merchant and let them know the options: 
  
  1. We restock and cancel the order and they refund the customer 
  2. They place a B2B order and provide us with a shipping label 
  3. They can ship it from their office.
