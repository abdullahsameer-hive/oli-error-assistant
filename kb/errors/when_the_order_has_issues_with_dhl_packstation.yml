  # When the order has issues with DHL Packstation
  
  FC:  🌏 General
  Resolution: Open page for resolution
  
  1. Check if both Packstation number and Postnummer are present (for Packstations only)
      1. If not → check the MX order in active admin and see if there is the information we did not sync 
          1. If yes → add the missing information to the address 
          2. If not -> `address validation` issue
      2. If yes → next step 
  2. Open the order in Google Maps and check if, in the Postal Code of the address, there is a Packstation or a Postfiliale with that Packstation number 
      1. If no, create `address validation` for the Packstation number 
      2. If yes, check in with Rohin how to troubleshoot this. 
  3. If the order keeps coming back in delivery restrictions with this same issue, reach out to the merchant via ticket: 
      
      Hi **NAME**,
      
      Happy **DAY OF THE WEEK**! We are currently processing your order **ORDER ID**, but we cannot ship it as it seems there is an issue with the address provided by your customer:
      
      **ENTER ADDRESS**
      
      I looked into this and I cannot find the **PACKSTATION/POSTIFILIALE** **NUMBER** in the postal code **ENTER POSTAL CODE**. The DHL **PACKSTATION/POSTFILIALE** I can see in Google Maps is **NUMBER** instead of **NUMBER**.
      
      Can you please reach out to your customer to provide a valid address, so we can ship out the order?
      
      Let me know if you have any questions!
