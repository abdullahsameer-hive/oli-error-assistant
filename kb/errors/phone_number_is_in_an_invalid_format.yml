  1. Check if the phone number has a country code with a ‘+’ sign before, not 00. 
      - If not → look for the country’s specific country code
      - If yes → raise address validation issue for an invalid phone number because it most likely an incorrect phone number
  2. **error message : telephone: "Spanish phone number is required for ePaq24 methods."**
  For 🇪🇸: The phone number can’t be a landline (starts with 9). Spanish carriers only accept mobile phone numbers (9 digits and starts with 6) because they can't send SMS to landlinee. Create an address validations and please modify the address validation message to “Spanish mobile phone number”
