  Open the edit button of the address field, see if there was missing number in the address that we did not assign to any field
  
  - If yes → add it to house number field
  - If not → next steps
  
  Open Google Maps to see if the street has house numbers:
  
  - if it does → create address validation issue for ‘house number’ missing and resolve the delivery restrictions issue.
  - if it doesn’t → enter a ‘-’ on the house number field and resolve the delivery restrictions issue.
