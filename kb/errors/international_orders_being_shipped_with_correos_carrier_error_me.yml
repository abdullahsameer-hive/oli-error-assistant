  - For this the shipment contains more than 5 SKUs and is being shipped with Correos carrier and the carrier has a restriction that they only accept a maximum of 5 parcel items
  - Make sure to check the value of the order is not >€150. You can check then in AA on orders page under “Total amount” field
      - If it is not - we can proceed to create the label manually in sendcloud
          - We need to create this label manually in Sendcloud by ‘bundling’ items with the same HS Code. You can usually also look at the Shop order items in the order in AA to see if there are already some bundles that apply. The goal is to create a label with only 5 items.
