  # Email address or phone number missing
  
  FC:  🌏 General
  Resolution: Open page for resolution
  
  Check the email id and phone number (compulsory for some carriers): either email id or phone number is compulsory. So please check if the order has an email id or phone number. 
  
  Check if the order is an ITO: 
  
  - If ITO → enter the data from this notion page for the corresponding destination [Hive FC Addresses](https://www.notion.so/Hive-FC-Addresses-b0550bb089744ff5b42b545933d0d7b4?pvs=21)
  - If not ITO → please create an `address validation` issue and select what is missing
