  Resolution: Reach out to the merchant and give them the following two options:
  • Cancel the shipment and create a duplicate with the order value in EUR, so we can process it with Delivengo.
  • Switch the carrier to Colissimo FR Domicile DAP International, which accepts GBP values.
  
  `Hi *(merchant name)*,`
  
  `Hope you are well.`
  
  `We are currently unable to process your order (*order number*) to the United Kingdom`
  
  `The orders have the currency set to GBP. Based on your current setup, the carrier Delivengo does not support processing shipments valued in GBP.`
  
  `To move forward, there are two options:`
  
  - `Cancel the shipment and create a duplicate with the order value in EUR, so we can process it with Delivengo.`
  - `Switch the carrier to Colissimo FR Domicile DAP International, which accepts GBP values.`
  
  `For future shipments, could you please confirm if we can use`
  
  **`Colissimo FR Domicile DAP International`**
  
  `for orders where the currency is not EUR, as these cannot be shipped with Delivengo?`
  
  `Could you please let us know how you’d like us to proceed with the order?`
  
  `Best,`
